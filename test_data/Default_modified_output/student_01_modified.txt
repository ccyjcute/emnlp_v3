On a sunny day, we were all excited about our graduation trip.
The first place we went on the first day was the Hou-Feng bike path.
To start with, we enjoyed cycling through "Tunnel No. 9."
After passing through the tunnel, we rode across the Dajia River Steel Bridge.
We took turns being a domestique; this way we could quickly finish riding and also saved our effort.
And if you look beside the road, we could see some landscape.
Take a look at the picture here, we could see a little waterfall, and behind the waterfall, we could see rolling hills.
Since we had some time to ride a bike after finishing all the Hou-Feng bike paths quickly, we decided to continue riding bikes.
We were hungry and thirsty due to riding bikes for a long time; therefore, we were finding something to eat.
After riding for about ten minutes, we found a hotdog stand, and their hotdog was very tasty.
Especially their Taiwanese sausage with sticky rice, which was really chewy.
At lunchtime, our classmates chose BBQ to eat.
With background music playing, we began to grill meat, vegetables, and toast.
When we were thirsty, we bought some beverages from the vending machine nearby.
During this time, though some food was burned, I still enjoyed the BBQ with my classmates, and it was a memorable time for me.
