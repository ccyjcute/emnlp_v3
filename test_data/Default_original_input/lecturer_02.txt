Okay, so first today, we are going to be looking at thermal conductivity and diffusivity. 

So, we know that thermal conductivity, or let's use red for that, thermal conductivit.

Let's write that down, and diffusivity, that's probably two words actually, so let's correct that, conductivity and diffusivity. 

And the reason we are discussing these two concepts together is because actually um, for energy and mass transport, or F transfer.

Uh, they share a lot of things in common, so they can be discussed together. 

But let's start with the thermal conductivity first, and we’re going to start this by looking at some thought experiment, like a hypothetical situation. 

Okay, so let's say that we have an infinite large slab. 

That's a solid slab, so let’s draw that down.

We have an infinite large slab like that, maybe we can draw it like a 3D dimension outwards. 
So, we have a very, very large slab. 

And, so let’s write that down.

So we have an infinite large solid slab, so it's infinitely large on two dimension, but it has a fixed dimension in the Z direction, or let's call it the Y direction. 

Okay, okay, so the infinite large slab is infinite in the lateral dimension, but it has a fixed dimension in the Y direction. 

So let's give it a definition.

Let's say that it has a thickness of L.
