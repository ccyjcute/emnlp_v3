Three students can’t join us today, so let’s combine the second and third groups. 

Hello, everyone, how are you? 

Happy to see you again. 

Welcome back to the class. 

Today's topic is Chapter 11: Living with Chronic Illness. 

Chronic illness is a health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects or a disease that comes with time. 

Now, we will start the class with a test. 

Please take out your cellphone or iPad, and scan the QR code. 

If you have any technical problems, please raise your hand. 

You have five minutes to answer the five questions. 

While you are taking the test, if you find any questions unclear, please raise your hand. 

This is today’s worksheet.

I will collate it at the end of today’s session. 

As you can see, these are the keywords we will cover today. 

I will give you two minutes to check their pronunciation. 

You can look them up in the dictionary or raise your hand to ask Hans for help. 

Before starting the first activity, I would like to invite you to read Mandy's story. 

How would you define health based on Mandy's story, and how does this definition differ from your own understanding of health?
