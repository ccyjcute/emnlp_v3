Let me ask you a question first: have you already enjoyed your graduation trip? 

If the answer is yes, please raise your hand.

Actually, the graduation trip allowed me to have many memories and was an important part of my high school life, so let me introduce our stellar graduation trip. 

Letâ€™s dive into it!

Our initial destination was Houfeng Bikeway. 

Each of us rented a bike and started to ride on the Houfeng Bikeway for 5.6 kilometers. 

We passed Houli Bikeway No.9 Tunnel and Railway Bridge across the Taiko River and encountered a lot of scenery along the way. 

The cozy breeze blew on us, and we felt pretty comfortable. 

However, one classmate fell off his bike and got injured, and I felt really sad about that. 

Fortunately, it was nothing serious, so he still enjoyed our trip.

We took pleasure in BBQ for lunch, but it was subpar due to some food being neglected. 

Some were burnt, and some were still raw. 

Anyways, it was still an interesting experience. 

Besides, while we enjoyed the BBQ, there was a music player playing J-Pop music, and we all immersed ourselves in it.

Our second destination of the first day was the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum. 

Initially, I considered that it would be a tedious place, but the fact said otherwise. 

Inside the museum, there are so many cultural heritage sites I had never seen before, and all of them made me develop a keen interest.

We stayed in Janfusan Resort Hotel for a night.
