On a sunny day, we were all excited about our graduation trip.
The first place we went on the first day was Hou-Feng bike path.
At first, we enjoyed cycling through "Tunnel No. 9."
After going through the tunnel, we rode across the Dajia River Steel Bridge.
We alternated being a domestique; therefore, we could quickly finish riding, and also saved our effort.
And beside the road, we could see some landscape.
Look at the picture here, we could see a little waterfall, and behind the waterfall, we could see rolling hills.
Due to having some time to ride a bike after finishing all Hou-Feng bike paths quickly, we decided to continue riding bikes.
We were hungry and thirsty because of riding bikes for a long time; hence, we were finding something to eat.
After riding for ten minutes, we found a hotdog stand, and their hotdog is very tasty.
Especially their Taiwanese sausage with sticky rice, it’s really chewy.
At lunchtime, our classmates chose BBQ to eat.
With background music, we began to grill meat, vegetables, and toast.
When we were thirsty, we bought some beverages from the vending machine nearby.
During the time, though some food was burned, I still enjoyed the BBQ with my classmates, and it’s a memorable time for me.
