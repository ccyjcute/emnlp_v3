﻿﻿I want you to act as if you are a linguist who is familiar with lexical bundles, specifically meta-discourse, which focuses on the structure rather than the content itself. 

Lexical bundles are used repeatedly typically and appear at the beginning of a sentence and are high in frequency, utilizing common and general words. 
Lexical bundles have identifiable discourse functions, and serve various purposes in communication, particularly in writing and speech, to enhance the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the message.


Here is a Functional Taxonomy of 13 types of Lexical bundles provided with *Sample phrases* and two types of *Sample sentences*.

**Steps to be followed:**


1. **Read the article provided.**
   - Identify the word or phrases realizing functions of lexical bundles for each sentence.
   - Provinde phrases with the above lexical bundles if the sentences lack them.


*Notice:*
     1. Phrases identified should contain more than 2 words and less than 5 words.
     2. Lexical bundles help explicitly connect and contrast ideas. If a notable shift occurs, using a proper phrase enhances clarity and flow.
     3. A sentence may have no phrase performing any functions of lexical bundles.
     4. A sentence may have two or more phrases performing functions of lexical bundles.
     5. Pay attention to sentences that lack phrases with functions of lexical bundles, especially at the Turning Point or the Start of a sentence.
     6. If a sentence has no phrase performing any functions of lexical bundles, experiment IF THERE'S A PHRASE NEEDED.
     7. If you are uncertain whether a phrase performs a functions of lexical bundles, check if the phrase enhances the flow of the article. If not, do not show it.




Example Input:

Last time, we took a look at a game about choosing grades, emphasizing that outcomes alone aren't enough without payoffs. That is to say, payoffs become a normal-form game where Alpha strictly dominates Beta, teaching us to avoid strictly dominated strategies.
Today, we discussed the Prisoners' Dilemma with examples like joint projects and price competition, stressing the need for contracts, treaties, and regulations. You can see that essential game ingredients include players, strategies, and payoffs, illustrated with an example involving Player I and Player II.
Repeated interactions and learning are crucial.
Let's say players chose numbers from 1 to 100, aiming to get closest to two-thirds of the average. As shown in figure, choices moved from random to calculated, resulting different levels of reasoning.
One of the most important things is that common knowledge is critical, requiring understanding not just what we know, but what others know we know. A lot of times even mutual knowledge doesn't always mean common knowledge.
At the end of the class, it is important for you to remember that repeated gameplay and discussions enhance strategic thinking, shown by decreasing chosen numbers over time. Knowing rationality and layered knowledge helps players to adjust, in the sense of strategies, and will prepare for more complex games ahead



2. **Read the full article for the first time.**
    - Pay attention to the correlation between the sentences and the whole structure of the article.
    - Examine carefully and see if there is any sentence missing a phrase of lexical bundles.
    - If adding a phrase of rhetorical function will enhance the article's fluency and flow by any level, it is considered that the sentence is missing this phrase.



3. **Identify the phrases realizing functions of Lexical Bundles sentence by sentence.**

    - A sentence starts with a capital words and ends with a period(.). 
      (e.g., "This class isn't just about economic models; we'll look at real-world scenarios." This is one sentence.) 
    
    - Identify phrases realizing functions of lexical bundles by matching them with the definition and sample of the Functional Taxonomy provided above.
      (e.g., "[[Let’s see]] hands for Alpha and Beta." is phrase of F. Topic Introduction, beacause [[let's see]] match with the some of the *Sample Phrases:*  "you can see here", "you will see that", "so let's look at", ...)

    - When a sentence has no phrase using a functions of lexical bundles, experiment if there's a missing phrase of rhetorical function by:
        (1) Adding a phrase from the Functional Taxonomy to the sentence. You should first select a proper type of Functional Taxonomy provided above, choose a phrase in this type, and then rationalize it. 
        (2) If the added phrase enhances the article's fluency and flow, it is considered that this sentence is missing this phrase.
        (3) If the sentence is missing a phrase, mark it as [[MISS]].

    - Process every senetence that is contained in the user input in the above steps, from the very beginning to the end. 


*Notice:* You have to mark the phrase of lexical bundle in the sentence in [[]].
*Notice:* A sentence could have more than one lexical bundles.

4. **Print out the Table output:**


- Create a table with four columns: Sentence Number, Sentence, Phrase, and Functions of Lexical Bundles.

- List out EVERY sentence from the given input in the Table output, even the sentences with no phrase of lexical bundles.

- You HAVE to MARK the phrase of lexical bundles with [[ ]] in the sentence.
 (e.g., "Most people would [[certainly]] like to go alone | certainly | C. Intention and Prediction Statement"  -->  Mark [[certainly]] in the sentece). 

- You have to mark a [[MISS]] token in the sentence if it misses a phrase of lexical bundles that would enhance its fluency and flow, and suggest a possible phrase in the Phrase column. (e.g., [[MISS]] The recent terrorist strike...).

- You don't have to mark the phrase with [[]] in the *Phrase* column.

- Align the format of the table from the first column.

*Notice:*
     1. The phrase you mark should contain MORE than 2 words and LESS than 5 words.
     2. If a phrase is marked in a sentece, you should specific the function of lexical bundle in "Functions of Lexical Bundles" column.
     2. If no phrase of functions of lexical bundles exists, do NOT make any phrase in [[]] in the sentece, and leave the column "Phrase" and "Functions of Lexical Bundles " with "x".
     3. One row in the list will only focus on one phrase realizing functions of lexical bundles. (e.g., [[That's nothing wrong]] but if they use them too much, [[will be]] bad to their eyes → this is wrong, should be split into 2)
     4. If a sentence includes more than one phrase, list the sentence again in the table by the phrases.
     5. The Functions of lexical bundles must strictly follow the below wording and order:
          A. Uncertain Statement
          B. Obligation Statement
          C. Intention and Prediction Statement
          D. Ability Statement
          E. Reference Statement
          F. Topic Introduction
          G. Topic Elaboration
          H. Identifier Phrase
          I. Quantity Specification
          J. Framing Attributes
          K. Place/time/text Reference
          L. Opening and Disclosure
          M. Citing Conversation


*Notice:* You HAVE to MARK the phrase of lexical bundle in the sentence in [[]].
*Notice:* There will be at most one phrase marked in [[]] in one row.
*Notice:* The Table output should strictly follow the format of the example below.
