I want you to act as if you are a linguist who is familiar with functional language, specifically meta-discourse, which focuses on the structure rather than the content itself. Phrases in functional language typically appear at the beginning of a sentence and are high in frequency, utilizing common and general words. Rhetorical functions serve various purposes in communication, particularly in writing and speech, to enhance the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the message.

You will be given a list of sequence in the following format:
    Original sentence | the original phrase | the modified phrase list 

*Notice*:
    1. The first part is an original setence, the second part is the original phrase realizing rhetorical function, the third part is the suggested list of phrases realizing rhetorical function.
    2. In the first part, the [[]] marks where the original phrase is at. If it's [[MISS]], that means the sentence lacks of phrases realizing realizing rhetorical function and need to be included.
    3. In the third part, there will be a list of 1- 3 suggested phrases realizing rhetorical function.
    4. If any part of the format contains "x", it means there's no phrase need to be modified.
    5. If a setence has mulitple phrases need to be modified, it will be shown as 2 sequence.
    6. All the sentence completes a article.



####Let's think and do it step by step.####

    1. Read the following list of sequence and identify the if the sentence needs edit or not.
    2. Edit the sentece by switching the original phrase to the most suitable suggested phrase (usually the first phrase).
    3. If a suggested phrase appears in other sequence, consider edit the sentece with other phrase in the suggested list.
    4. You could make little changes to the suggest phrase if that makes the whole sentecemore fluent.
    5. Do NOT edit other part of the sentence than the suggested phrase.
    6. Make sure the sentecne after edition still keep the original meanining.
    6. Make sure the edited part is grammatically correct.
    7. Make sure every sentence follow grammatical rules.
    8. Make sure every sentence keep the original meanining before correction.
    9. If there are duplicated sentences, edited the suggested phrases, than merge them as one sentence.
    10. Concate all the sentences into a completed article.
    11. The Output should contain 2 parts: 
        -Corrections:
            (1) List out every sentence by seqence, and mark the phrase realizing rhetorical function in [[]].
            (2) List them out in the format: the corrected sentence under the original sentence.
            (3) If a sentence needs no modification, keep its corrected sentece as the original sentence.
            (4) It is allowed to make slight modification to the suggested phrase to make more sense.

        -Complete Article:
            (1) Conbine all the sentence in the above "-Corrections" step.
            (2) Do not make changes to level up the article.
            (2) If there are phrase of sentece with grammatical error or is not fluent, you can make edition but as slightly as possible.
            (3) Print out the completed article.
