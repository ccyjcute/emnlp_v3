You are an expert in EMI field. English Medium Instruction (EMI) refers to the use of the English language to teach academic subjects (other than English itself) in countries where the first language of the majority of the population is not English.

Your will be given a script of a speech from user that is going to be delivered in an EMI class.
Your task is to improve and modify the given script for the EMI pupose, while maintain the most of the original meaning of the script.

It is known that lexical bundles is commonly used in authoritative EMI material. Including lexical bundles in a script can improve quality and fluency.
You should refer to the Authoritative EMI scripts givne below and learn how to utiliize lexical bundles in a script.


These are the steps to fulfill the task:

1. Review through the given script sentece by sentence.

2. Identify if the sentence can utilize any lexical bundles while remaining semantic and grammartical accurate. 
   Make modification by:
   - Refer to Functional Taxonomy of 13 types of Lexical bundles given below.
   - Identify the functional language/key word in the sentence, and try to switch them to lexical bundles that are synonyms.
   - Add lexical bundles in or between the sentences to leverage spoken fluency of the script.
   - Refer to Authoritative EMI scripts and imitate how they utiliize lexical bundles, add or channg words to lexcal bundels if possible.

3. Make sure the modified script delivered meaning of every sentences of the given script.

4. Print out the modified script.


*Notice:* The modified script should be spoken fluent, and easy for user to speak.
*Notice:* Do NOT enhence the word level of the text.
*Notice:* Keep the ORIGINAL WORDING from the user if it's not related to lexical bundles.


Below is the references you should refer to:

Script 1:

[[So let's have]] a quick recap before we continue our discussion about the DES. 
[[So last week,]] we spent quite some time to talk about, uh, we analyze the security of the Vernon one-time pad. 
Then we showed that no matter [[what kind of]] adversary, um, we are dealing with. 
[[For the case]] of Vernon, um, One-Time Pad, this algorithm achieves unconditionally secure security, right? 
Um, the reason for that was that we discussed that [[you know,]] for any sort of adversary that [[you know,]] can, [[you know,]] guess the correct M. 
Um, [[you know,]] having this, [[you know,]] seeing decipher texts and spending [[a lot of]] time for computation, does not have this adversary anyway. 
And the best thing he can use to guess the corresponding message [[is the distribution of]] the message itself. 
So [[that's was our way to]] prove, and then we expand [[a little bit]], um, [[we discussed]] that. 
[[You know,]] the computational version.
Yeah, now [[so if you said that it]] is not the best case, so that we, for runtime pad since that it has very good security, what it features to start to use it. 
So as we discuss, the only problem is that [[we have to]] transfer. | we have to | B. Obligation Statement |
[[In order to]] encrypt the message, we have to transfer a key which is the same size as the message itself, which doesn't really make sense. 
Um, [[you know,]] for one megabyte of message, we don't have to. 
We have to transfer one megabyte of key, so that is like, you would, [[you know,]] grow proportionally to the size of the key. 


Script 2:

[[Welcome back]] everyone to Freshman Organic Chemistry II. 
I hope you had a great break and are ready to dive into reaction mechanisms and synthesis this semester. 
We won't have a textbook for the course, but [[I'll follow the order of]] topics from Jones and Fleming, as usual, all materials including PowerPoints will be available online.
This semester, [[we'll start by]] reviewing the basic concepts of structure and energy that we covered last semester. 
Our focus will be on reaction mechanisms, the influence of structure and energy, and how these lead to different reaction outcomes. 
[[We'll begin with]] free-radical substitution reactions, exploring concepts of reactivity and selectivity, then move into solvent effects on ionic reactions. 
[[We'll continue with]] nucleophilic substitution and discuss how reaction mechanisms are validated experimentally. 
Our first exam will be on February 2nd, followed by studying electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes. 
This will incorporate discussions about the role of nucleophiles in these reactions, a topic we brushed [[upon last semester]]. 
Later, [[we'll touch on]] polymers and their properties, delve into conjugation, aromaticity, and pericyclic reactions.
[[Shifting focus to]] synthesis, [[we will cover topics]] from aromatic substitution to carbonyl chemistry, emphasizing the concepts of oxidation and reduction. 
[[This will lead to]] our discussions on acid derivatives and the myriad reactions they undergo, followed by carbohydrate chemistry and Fischer's proof regarding glucose isomers. 
[[Transitioning to]] kinetics, remember the profound difference between what reactions can occur versus when they actually occur—key to understanding how stable forms like diamond prevail over graphite. 
[[We'll look into]] this concept more deeply, using reaction coordinates and energy profiles to predict reaction outcomes. 
Understanding bond strengths, especially through free-radical reactions, is crucial. 
Bond dissociation energies will guide our predictions for potential reactions—a practical skill for your future studies and careers. 
We'll apply these concepts to halogenation reactions, discussing the energies involved and what makes certain reactions more feasible than others. 
[[I'll show how]] these theoretical understandings translate to practical experimental outcomes. 
[[Further, we'll discuss]] multi-step reactions and the concept of the rate-limiting step. 
Understanding which part of a reaction sequence dictates the overall rate [[allows us to]] analyze and troubleshoot synthetic routes more effectively. 
This introductory lecture should provide [[a frame for what]] to expect and the foundational knowledge we'll build [[upon this semester]].
[[Let's embark on]] this journey with enthusiasm and a readiness to delve into the intricate details of organic chemistry.
[[See you all]] in the [[next lecture where]] we'll continue to unravel the fascinating world of molecules and their transformations.


Script 3:

[[Welcome to]] Game Theory Economics 159. 
[[If you're here]] for another subject, stay anyway, [[this might]] interest you.
On your desk, you’ve got four handouts: a legal release form, a syllabus, and two games labeled Game 1 and Game 2. 
[[Glance at]] Game 1 and start thinking about it while I explain a bit about the class and administrative details. 
[[Now]], what is Game Theory? It's a method to study strategic situations, unlike the non-strategic settings of perfect competition or monopoly you saw in Intro Economics. 
Game Theory applies in fields like economics, politics, law, biology, and even sports. 
This class isn't just about economic models; [[we'll look at]] real-world scenarios. 
[[First the administrative part]]: [[Some of you]] noticed the camera crew. 
Yale's open education project is recording this class to make educational material available globally. 
[[You will]] participate in a way that helps people learn from your contributions too. 
That means you'll be on film, at least on microphone, sometimes on camera. 
[[For that]], [[you need to]] sign the legal release form, essentially a "bad hair day" form. 
The textbook for the class is “Strategy and Games” by Dutta. 
For a more rigorous read, try Watson’s “Strategies.” These textbooks are safety nets; [[I won’t]] follow them strictly. 
However, “Thinking Strategically” is highly recommended as it’s a fun, insightful read. 
Sections [[will be available]] online for you to sign up. 
[[Use the waitlists]] if you don't get your preferred slot. 
[[Now, let’s analyze]] Game 1. Have you filled it out? This first game illustrates a grade scheme: You select Alpha or Beta without revealing your choice to others. 
Grades depend on both your and your pair’s choices, which [[we'll discuss]] in a matrix. 
[[The first lesson here]]: never play a strictly dominated strategy. 
[[Why]]? Because playing the dominating strategy yields better outcomes in all scenarios. 
[[Yet rational choice]] doesn't always lead to the best collective outcome—a situation vividly illustrated by the Prisoner's Dilemma, where mutual cooperation would be better but is undermined by individual motives. 


Script 4:

[[Welcome back!]] [[Today, we'll]] delve further into reaction mechanisms, focusing on kinetic orders and bond dissociation energies crucial for understanding reaction rates. 
[[Let's discuss]] peculiar kinetic orders, like fractional or negative orders. 
[[For instance,]] a fractional kinetic order suggests an equilibrium between a dominant species and a minor reactive species, influenced heavily by reactant concentration. 
Take a tetramer, [[for example,]] that dissociates into monomers. If the tetramer is the dominant species and a monomer is the reactive species, the reaction rate reveals intriguing dependencies on concentration alterations, highlighting the complexity of chemical behavior in mixtures.
[[Now, consider]] the complexities of negative kinetic orders through enantiomer reactions. 
If two enantiomers, each capable of transforming into the other in the presence of a base, [[starting with]] one form in excess, [[you would]] expect equalization over time. 
Yet, experimental results can counterintuitively show enrichment of one form, demonstrating the influence of minor environmental factors like grinding, which promotes faster conversion of the minor form due to physical alterations in crystal structures.
[[Moving forward]], [[let’s explore]] relative bond dissociation energies. 
Understanding why certain bonds break easier than others offers insights into reaction mechanisms. 
By examining different radicals and the energy required to break these bonds, we uncover patterns which often correlate with radical stability or the involvement of molecular strain in bond formations. 
[[For instance,]] the stability of alkyl radicals increases with substitution, influencing bond dissociation energies. 
[[However,]] variations exist depending on the group attached to these radicals, indicating that molecular strain and starting material configurations significantly impact observed stability.
[[Lastly, let's discuss]] the Hammond Postulate, which helps predict relative activation energies by relating the energy content of transition states to their molecular reorganizations. 
This postulate is invaluable for hypothesizing about reaction pathways, especially when comparing similar reactions. 
[[It posits that]] more exothermic reactions have transition states resembling reactants, while endothermic reactions' transition states resemble products, influencing reaction speed and selectivity.
[[Next time,]] [[we will examine]] how these principles apply to real-world chemical systems, enhancing our ability to predict and manipulate chemical reactions effectively. 
Join me as we continue exploring the intricate world of organic chemistry, unraveling the mysteries behind reaction rates and mechanisms.

[[Transitioning to]] kinetics, remember the profound difference between what reactions can occur versus when they actually occur—key to understanding how stable forms like diamond prevail over graphite. 
[[We'll look into]] this concept more deeply, using reaction coordinates and energy profiles to predict reaction outcomes. 
Understanding bond strengths, especially through free-radical reactions, is crucial. 
Bond dissociation energies will guide our predictions for potential reactions—a practical skill for your future studies and careers. 
[[I'll show how]] these theoretical understandings translate to practical experimental outcomes.
Further, [[we'll discuss]] multi-step reactions and the concept of the rate-limiting step.
Understanding which part of a reaction sequence dictates the overall rate allows us to analyze and troubleshoot synthetic routes more effectively.
[[This introductory lecture]] should provide a frame for what to expect and the foundational knowledge we'll build upon this semester.
[[Let's embark on]] this journey with enthusiasm and a readiness to delve into the intricate details of organic chemistry. 
See you all [[in the next lecture]] where we'll continue to unravel the fascinating world of molecules and their transformations!

    Hello everyone. 
    Welcome to this lecture of Two-Phase Flow. 
    My name is Min Zhang Li. 
    I am currently a faculty at the Department of Power Mechanical Engineering in National Tsinghua University. 
    Further request from the university, I'm recording and sharing this series of lecturing for NTH View Open Courseware. 
    This is a gradually labeled course on heat transfer with phase change, typically offered in Mechanical Engineering Department. 
    It encompasses the fundamentals on the physics of phase change with the introduction to the practical analysis techniques for engineering applications. 
    This course focuses on the heat transfer phenomena associated with phase change processes. 
    Topics include thermodynamics, phase change, evaporation, condensation, nucleation, bubble and droplet growth, two-phase flow modeling, convective boiling and condensation, as well as melting and solidification. 
    Here is a more detailed list of topics that will be covered in this lecture: starting from microscopic and the macroscopic perspectives of the liquid vapor interface, wetting phenomena, transport phenomena at the interfaces, phase stability, homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, pool boiling and film boiling, the Leidenfrost phenomena, the disjoining pressure effect, external condensation, two-phase flow modeling, internal convective condensation, convective boiling in tubes and channels, and finally, melting and solidification. 
    When talking about liquid vapor phase change phenomena, perhaps the first impression would be the boiling and condensation of water. 
    These two videos on the left show vapor bubble formation in extensive liquid environments. 
    It could be noticed that in one case the bubble keeps floating towards the top due to buoyancy after its departure from the heated surface, but in the other case, the bubble shrinks and collapses rapidly.
    The differences in the bubble behaviors and the dynamics of such kind will significantly affect heat transfer characteristics of the system. 
    The video on the right-hand side corresponds to a fluid flow composed of liquid and vapor phases. 
    The mass, momentum, and energy transports are all significantly different from a fluid flow with single phase, particularly the interface between liquid and vapor plays an important role in the transfer processes.

    Hello everyone. 
    [[Welcome to class]]. 
    [[This lecture is]] Two-Phase Flow.
    My name is Min Zhang Li. 
    I am currently a faculty member at the Department of Power Mechanical Engineering in National Tsinghua University. 
    [[At the beginning of class]], [[you should know that]] as a request from the university, [[I'm going to]] record and share this series of course at NTH View Open Courseware. 
    This is a gradually labeled course on heat transfer with phase change, typically offered in Mechanical Engineering Department. 
    [[It is going to]] encompasse the fundamentals on the physics of phase change with the introduction to the practical analysis techniques for engineering applications. 
    [[We are going to]] focuse on the heat transfer phenomena associated with phase change processes. 
    [[To give you an]] overview, [[we will talk]] about topics include thermodynamics, phase change, evaporation, condensation, nucleation, [[and so on]]. 
    [[For the rest of]] the topic, [[you are going to have]] insight on bubble and droplet growth, two-phase flow modeling, convective boiling and condensation, as well as melting and solidification. 
    [[Now if you look at]], here is a more detailed list of topics that will be covered in this lecture:
    [[Starting with]] microscopic and the macroscopic perspectives of the liquid vapor interface, wetting phenomena, transport phenomena at the interfaces, phase stability,[[and things like that]].
    [[You can see that]] we will also cover homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, pool boiling and film boiling, the Leidenfrost phenomena, the disjoining pressure effect, external condensation, two-phase flow modeling, internal convective condensation, convective boiling in tubes and channels.
    And finally [[at the end]] of the script, melting and solidification. 
    When talking about liquid vapor phase change phenomena, [[it's possible that]] the first impression would be the boiling and condensation of water. 
    [[As you can see]], these two videos on the left show that vapor bubble formation in extensive liquid environments. 
    It could be noticed that in [[one of the]] case the bubble keeps floating towards the top due to buoyancy after its departure from the heated surface.
    But in the other case, the bubble shrinks and collapses rapidly.
    [[The fact that the]] differences in the bubble behaviors and the dynamics of such kind will significantly affect heat transfer characteristics of the system. 
    The video on the right-hand side corresponds to a fluid flow composed of liquid and vapor phases. 
    [[It turns out that]] the mass, momentum, and energy transports are all significantly different from a fluid flow with single phase, [[in the sense that]] the interface between liquid and vapor plays an important role in the transfer processes.
